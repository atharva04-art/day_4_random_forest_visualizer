# 🌲 Day 4 - Random Forest Classifier with Confusion Matrix

This project demonstrates the use of a **Random Forest Classifier** to classify the Iris flower dataset.  
We also evaluate the model using a **confusion matrix**, a **classification report**, and **custom predictions** to understand its performance in detail.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Built-in Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`
- **Features**:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
- **Target Classes**:

## 🤖 Model Used
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
